DEKRYPTIZE
==========

Dekryptize is a command line ncurses decryption animation to make decryption
look like decryption. The plaintext input is read from standard input --
or if a filename is supplied, from that file.

For additional effect, wear a black hoodie and sunglasses to your demo
and use a hacky desktop environment, like Kali Linux (remember, root=toor). 

Created one afternoon at work for an actual business case. Inspired by "sl" 
(sudo apt install sl), which is much cooler.

Cheers,
