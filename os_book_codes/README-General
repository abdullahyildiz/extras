Simulation homeworks come in the form of simulators you run to make sure you
understand some piece of the material. The simulators are generally python
programs that enable you both to generate different problems (using different
random seeds) as well as to have the program solve the problem for you (with
the -c flag) so that you can check your answers. Running any simulator with a
-h or --help flag will provide with more information as to all the options the
simulator gives you.

In this directory, you can see a number of different simulators. The relevant
book chapters provide some questions that you might want to try to answer; or,
you can make up your own questions! (if you do, and they are good, feel free
to send them our way).

Enjoy!
